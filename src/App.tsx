          <aside className="notes">
            Welcome everyone! Today we're going to explore JavaScript Signals, a
            new and exciting approach to state management that's gaining
            traction in the JavaScript ecosystem. This presentation will cover
            both the theoretical concepts and practical implementations across
            different frameworks.

          <h2>Understanding State in JavaScript</h2>
          <p>What is state and why does it matter?</p>
          <aside className="notes">
            State is the heart of any interactive application. It represents the
            data that changes over time and drives our UI updates. Traditional
            state management often leads to complex code and performance issues.
            This is where Signals come in as a potential solution. Think of
            state as the memory of your application - it needs to be both
            efficient and predictable.

            <h2>Types of State</h2>
            <p>Different levels of state in modern applications</p>
            <aside className="notes">
              Understanding the different types of state is crucial for choosing
              the right state management solution. Each type has its own
              challenges and requirements for management and updates.

            <h3>Component State</h3>
            <p>State that belongs to and is managed by a single component</p>

            />
            <aside className="notes">
              Component state is the most localized form of state. Think of it
              as the internal memory of a component. While simple to manage, it
              can become problematic when you need to share this state with
              other components. This is where we often start seeing prop
              drilling and complex component hierarchies. This is like the color
              of a button, whether it is disabled or enabled, checked or
              unchecked, etc.

            <p>State shared between multiple components in a specific area</p>
            <p>Story of your app at any given time</p>

            <aside className="notes">
              <p>
                Application state represents a middle ground - it's shared but
                not global. This is where many applications start to introduce
                state management libraries. The challenge here is maintaining
                consistency while keeping the code maintainable.
              </p>{" "}
              <p>
                This is like the theme of your app, whether it is light or dark,
                whether it is a dark mode or light mode, etc.
              </p>{" "}
              <p>
                If you have a snapshot of your state, you could technically
                restore your app to a given state at that time, if your
                components support it.

              Global state is the most challenging to manage effectively. It's
              like having a shared memory that every part of your application
              can access and modify. This is where traditional solutions often
              fall short, leading to complex update patterns and performance
              issues.

            TC39 is the technical committee responsible for evolving JavaScript.
            It's made up of representatives from major browser vendors, tech
            companies, and JavaScript experts. When TC39 approves a proposal, it
            becomes part of the JavaScript language itself, available natively
            in all browsers. This means Signals could become a built-in feature
            of JavaScript, not just a library or framework feature. The
            committee follows a rigorous process with multiple stages, ensuring
            proposals are well-thought-out and widely supported.

            The TC39 process ensures that new JavaScript features are thoroughly
            vetted before becoming part of the language. Each stage requires
            increasing levels of detail and implementation experience. Signals
            are currently at Stage 1, which means they have a formal proposal
            but still need significant work before becoming part of JavaScript.
            This process helps prevent bad features from being added to the
            language and ensures compatibility across different JavaScript
            environments.

            When a feature becomes part of the JavaScript language through TC39,

            library implementations and no need for additional dependencies. A
            standardized implementation ensures consistent behavior across
            different environments. Writing code that uses TC39-approved

              with vanilla JavaScript to understand the fundamentals, then move

              interesting - it provides a way to react to signal changes. Notice
              the async nature of the watcher callback - this is intentional to
              prevent synchronous signal access. The lazy evaluation of computed
              signals is a key performance optimization.

              SolidJS has one of the most elegant implementations of signals.
              The createSignal function returns a tuple with a getter and setter

              the value - this is what enables the fine-grained reactivity. The
              createMemo function creates a derived signal that automatically
              updates when its dependencies change. This is much simpler than
              traditional state management solutions and provides better
              performance.
